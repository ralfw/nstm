Installation
------------
In order to compile this solution you need to first install PostSharp on your
development machine and check that the NSTM projects reference the correct
PostSharp dlls. Download PostSharp from www.postsharp.org.


Usage
-----
The NSTM core is just a single assembly: NSTM.dll. However, if you want to use
the [NstmTransactional] or [NstmAtomic] attributes, you need to also deploy
PostSharp´s PostSharp.Laos.dll and PostSharp.Public.dll and reference them in the
project using NSTM.
