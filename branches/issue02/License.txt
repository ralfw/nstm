To provide the NstmTransactionalAttribute functionality the PostSharp 1.0 Library (c) by Gael Fraiteur is used.
See the references to PostSharp.Public and PostSharp.Laos in the NSTM project.

Download PostSharp from http://www.postsharp.org/ if you want to use the NstmTransactionalAttribute in your
applications, since the PostSharp post-compiler is needed to enhance your compiled assemblies.
